# Clique-Cover
Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define the Graph**: Use `networkx` to create the graph.
2. **Formulate the Ising Model**: Convert the clique cover constraints into an Ising Hamiltonian.
3. **Submit to D-Wave**: Use D-Wave’s tools to solve the Ising problem.
Step 1: Define the Graph

First, install the required libraries if you haven't already:
sh
pip install dwave-system networkx

Step 2: Formulate the Ising Model

To convert the clique cover problem to an Ising model, we need to set up the Hamiltonian. Here's the Python code to do this:

python
from dimod import Spin, BinaryQuadraticModel
from collections import defaultdict

Step 3: Submit to D-Wave

Finally, solve the Ising model using D-Wave:

python
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite

Explanation

- **Graph Definition**: A simple graph `G` is defined using `networkx`.
- **Ising Formulation**: 
  - `h` is the linear term representing individual biases of the spins.
  - `J` is the quadratic term representing interactions between spins.
  - The constraints are converted such that each node belongs to exactly one clique, and each edge is covered by at least one clique.
- **Solving**: The Ising problem is solved using D-Wave’s sampler, and the solution is interpreted to identify the cliques.
